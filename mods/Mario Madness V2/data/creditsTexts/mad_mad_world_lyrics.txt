"It's a mad, mad world" performed by Ultra M.
O, How sweet
A bitter defeat
at hands of all of us
and all of me
And after it's over,
and after the final curtain has closed.
So when the script is made true,
Complete removal of you,
Is the outcome...
Is this really the outcome...?

But will it be the same...
With you gone?
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world
It's a mad, mad world
Without you.

The stage is set, but our players have all gone home.
Our great production, our world, and yet I'm alone...
You've met your maker,
I've said my peace...
So why won't this feeling cease?

And so it clutches around my soul...

I feel the bitter, everlasting cold.

...Is this what I wanted?
Am I satisfied...?
And now I'm standing tall
Yet all I want to do
is hide inside...
This empty shell...
This husk,
this world,
this empty hell.
I wander through,
My song reigns true,
The world is mad,
And I am too,
Without you.
