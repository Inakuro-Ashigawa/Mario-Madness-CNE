Voice of MX, Menu concept artist
Hello! I'm Sunset, I did voices for MX, Commercial Guy in the first v2 trailer, and made a concept for the menu. I didn't do too much or interact with the dev team often, but I did get to stick around and watch everything flourish! Everyone's work was amazing. The devs of this mod were very creative and talented with their work, Thank you for Playing!!
