Artist/Animator, Charter, Assisting Coder
Hey, I'm Nate. I did WAY too much art for this mod as well as a handful of charts and some extra coding here and there. I'm really glad and lucky i got to work on this mod and improve along with all of the amazing people i've met over the past year and a half. Hope you enjoyed our hard work.
