Notakin
Pixel Artist and Animator
I did the base art and animation for GB's first and second phases, Grand Dad's and BF's NES sprites, with some help from GP and Marco, GP did GB's laugh animation but besides that it's mostly me who did the dirty work, i think this took me 5 months for GB and 1 day for Grand Dad, because I was working on another game "PROJECT: NG", a Newgrounds Fighting Game, you should check it out sometime.
